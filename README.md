"In this tutorial we are going to show you how to write string replace java application. This simple application is processing directories tree recursively and finds files with a given extension. For each file that has appropriate extension a processing is done â€“ we find strings and replace it with other strings. String replace definition is held in a separate file and loaded at the beginning of the program." This is a tutorial material. Feel free to use it. For more info check our website itcuties.com
